# This file does the actual work of selecting and reading in the RAW           #
# magnetic field data for Jupiter as specified by the user. For user           #
# specification use, e.g., DemoJupiterAtmo3D.arts (or its 1D equivalent) as    #
# template. The template also contains the detailed information on which       #
# indices are linked to which specific value/selection for each of the         #
# variables. The full arrays, which the indices refer to and from which the    #
# actual values are extracted, are defined in atmo_mars.arts (hence,           #
# atmo_mars.arts needs to be included before the file at hand).                #
