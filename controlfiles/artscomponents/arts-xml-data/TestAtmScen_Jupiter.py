#
# Testing functionality (meeting format requirements, etc.) of basic atmospheric
#  scenario data.
#
# General test setup: reading in raw data, regridding to common p-grid (1D),
#  executing standard pre-RT calc internal test method atmfields_checkedCalc.
#
#
# This case is for Jupiter and specifically tests
#
# (CASE A)
#  - from MPS/Jupiter.mean: t, z, and all abs species vmr (the ones that follow
#     the basename convention are caught by abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario and
#     AtmRawRead; others are derived manually) in the case folder AND in the
#     "unused/" subfolder (for the latter we have to tweak abs_species setting a
#     little).
# (CASE B)
# - from MPS/Jupiter.oval: t, z (re-using the vmr profiles from Jupiter.mean).
#
# - regridding to a pressure grid taken from the read-in altitude grid
# - regridding to a user defined pressure grid (we chose one that is covers a
#    slightly larger p-range than the original data in order to test the
#    extrapolation and zero-padding features).
